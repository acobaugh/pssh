# parallel-ssh

This is an attempt to reboot pssh. 

## Goals

* Cleaner code, where possible
* Incorporate many of the patches and fix many of the issues found at
  https://github.com/lilydjwg/pssh/issues
* Add a few features (-L/--list-hosts, for one)

## Original README.md
PSSH provides parallel versions of OpenSSH and related tools, including pssh, pscp, prsync, pnuke and pslurp. This project includes psshlib which can be used within custom applications. The source code is written in Python

PSSH is supported on Python 2.5 and later (including Python 3.1 and later). It was originally written and maintained by Brent N. Chun. Due to his busy schedule, Brent handed over maintenance to Andrew McNabb in October 2009.

This project originally located at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/). Since Google Code has been closed, and has not appeared elsewhere, I (lilydjwg) have exported it to GitHub.
